# Project Overview and Description

Pig Game is a simple two-player dice game built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game simulates rolling a dice randomly in each player's turn. <br/>
A player can roll the dice multiple times per turn. If the result is not 1, the number is added to their temporary score. However, if the player rolls a 1, <br/>
they lose all temporary points for that turn and the turn passes to the next player. Players can also choose to "Hold" to save their current temporary score <br/>
to the total score. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.

The app uses:
- JavaScript for game logic and event handling <br/>
- HTML for structuring the UI <br/>
- CSS for styling the layout and animations <br/>

Key features:
- Random dice roll using Math.random() <br/>
- Turn-based logic between two players <br/>
- Score tracking (temporary and total) <br/>
- Win condition at 100 points <br/>
- Responsive and interactive UI
